Hello, I'm Filipe!

I've been working as a data analyst for about 4 years and have experience in all stages of a data project, including collection, storage, modeling, visualization, and data insights, using various tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, Google Analytics, and Data Studio. I demonstrate the ability to translate business problems into technical solutions, proposing new processes, analyses, and report automation. I have also worked as a process analyst, with broad experience in dealing with different business areas for internal process improvement. Additionally, I implemented the Pipefy tool (BPM) in various areas, including Customer Service, HR, Finance, Media, and Performance, to enhance process management.

Here you will find projects showcasing some of my skills.
